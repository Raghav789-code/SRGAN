Week 1: Fundamentals of Image Super-Resolution and GANs What is Image Super-Resolution (SR)? Image Super-Resolution (SR) is the process of enhancing the resolution of an image from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR). It focuses on reconstructing fine image details like textures and edges that are typically lost when downsampling an image.
Types of Super-Resolution:
Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR): Enhancing a single image.
Multi-Image Super-Resolution: Combining information from multiple low-res images.
Video Super-Resolution: Temporal enhancement across video frames.
Challenges in Super-Resolution:
Image details lost in LR cannot be fully recovered.
Requires intelligent learning of patterns from data.
Need for balancing between perceptual quality and quantitative measures like PSNR.
Introduction to GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks): A GAN consists of two neural networks:
Generator (G): Tries to generate images that look like real HR images.
Discriminator (D): Tries to distinguish between real HR images and generated fake images.
Both networks are trained together in a minimax game:
Generator tries to fool the Discriminator.
Discriminator tries not to be fooled.
This adversarial training helps in producing sharper and more realistic outputs.
SRGAN Paper Summary (Ledig et al., 2017): Title: "Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network" 
Proposed the first GAN-based approach for Super-Resolution.
