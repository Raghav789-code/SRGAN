Week 2: SRGAN Architecture, Loss Functions & ESRGAN Understanding the Generator Architecture (SRGAN):
Initial convolutional layer with PReLU activation.
Followed by 16 Residual Blocks (Residual Learning).
Skip Connection: Adds initial feature maps back after residual blocks.
Upsampling layers: PixelShuffle layers to increase spatial resolution by 4x.
Final convolution outputs a 3-channel HR image (RGB).
Discriminator Architecture (SRGAN):
A standard CNN classifier.
Several Convolutional + BatchNorm + LeakyReLU layers.
Followed by Dense layers, ending with a Sigmoid output to classify real vs fake images.
SRGAN Loss Functions: Content Loss (Perceptual Loss):
Calculated using feature maps from a pre-trained VGG network.
Focuses on perceptual similarity instead of just pixel-wise difference.
Adversarial Loss:
Based on output from the Discriminator.
Encourages the Generator to produce images that the Discriminator cannot distinguish from real HR images.
Total Generator Loss:
A combination of Content Loss and Adversarial Loss.
Introduction to ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN): Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219 Improvements over SRGAN:
Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDBs): Deeper and more stable architecture.
Relativistic Discriminator: Focuses on making real images look more realistic than generated ones.
Improved Perceptual Loss (VGG-54 layer instead of VGG-34): Helps generate more photo-realistic textures.
Removes BatchNorm layers for better detail recovery.
