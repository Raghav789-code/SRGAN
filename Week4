Week 4: Performance Metrics (PSNR, SSIM), Training Tricks and Improvements Implemented Evaluation Metrics: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):
Measures pixel-wise similarity between generated and ground truth HR images.
Higher PSNR indicates better image quality.
Formula: PSNR=10×log10​(MSEMAX2​) Where MAX is 1 (after normalization) and MSE is Mean Squared Error.
SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure):
Measures perceptual similarity in terms of luminance, contrast, and structure.
Ranges from -1 to 1 (closer to 1 = better similarity).
Training Improvements Implemented: Label Smoothing:
Instead of training Discriminator with hard 1/0 labels, used soft labels like 0.9 and 0.1.
Helps prevent Discriminator from becoming too confident too early.
Learning Rate Scheduler:
Used PyTorch's StepLR / MultiStepLR.
Reduced learning rate at specific epochs to stabilize training.
Generator Pretraining:
First trained the Generator with pixel-wise L1 Loss or MSE Loss for stabilization.
Then switched to adversarial training with GAN Loss + Perceptual Loss.
Normalization for VGG Input:
Normalized input images to match VGG's ImageNet-trained statistics (mean=[0.485,0.456,0.406], std=[0.229,0.224,0.225]) for better perceptual loss calculation.
Gradient Clipping (Optional):
Clipped gradients to avoid exploding gradients.
Batch Size and Epochs:
Batch Size: 16
Pretraining Epochs: 100
Adversarial Training Epochs: 100+
