Week 3: DIV2K Dataset Preparation, LR-HR Pair Generation, and Custom PyTorch Dataset About the DIV2K Dataset:
Full Form: DIVerse 2K resolution dataset.
Provides high-quality HR images for Super-Resolution research.
Training Set: 800 images
Validation Set: 100 images
Testing Set: 100 images (without ground truth for benchmarking)
Steps I Followed for Dataset Preparation: Downloading the DIV2K dataset:
Used the TensorFlow dataset catalog: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/div2k
Alternatively downloaded images manually.
Generating LR-HR Pairs:
Downsampling Method: Bicubic downsampling.
Downsampled the HR images by scale factor 4 to get LR images.
Example: Original HR image size: 2040x2040 Generated LR image size: 510x510
Custom PyTorch Dataset:
Created a Python class inheriting from torch.utils.data.Dataset.
Loaded both HR and LR images.
Applied necessary transformations: Tensor conversion, Normalization.
Supported DataLoader batching for training.
PyTorch DataLoader:
Split dataset into train and validation.
Used DataLoader for efficient batch loading.
Implemented custom dataset following: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html
